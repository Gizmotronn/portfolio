                            <p>
                                Everton suffered a really annoying loss last match day, going down to Burnley at Turf Moor 1-0 after Seamus Coleman was sent off. It leaves us with 7 points from 3 league matches, with 4 losses in a row (Bournemouth (a),  Sheffield United (h), Manchester City (h), Burnley (a)) and leaves us in the relegation spot of 18th. On the other hand, West Ham are 8th with 8 points from 5 games. They may end up being one of the surprise packets this season, so let's get into the match preview.
                            </p>

                            <h3>
                                Form going into this match
                            </h3>

                            <h4>
                                Everton
                            </h4>
                            <p>
                                In Everton's 8 games this year, we've won 2, drawn 1 and lost 5 to be sitting in 18th spot. We started off the season in typical Everton fashion, drawing 0-0 away to Palace, before rebounding with a win against Watford (1-0, h), a loss against Aston Villa (2-0, a), and a win against Wolves (3-2, h). Unfortunately, the wheels seem to have fallen off since then, as we sit currently with 5 straight losses, including losses to recently promoted Sheffield United and to last season's cellar dwellars Burnley & Bournemouth. The most encouraging part of this run was our loss (3-1, h) to Man City. The players seemed to be genuinely playing for the badge, and the line-up was encouraging.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In between this run of poor form, we had 2 good EFL Cup wins, against Lincoln City & Sheffield Wednesday (4-2 a, 2-0 a respectively).
                            </p>
                            <h4>
                                West Ham
                            </h4>
                            <p>
                                West Ham are 8th with 3 wins, 3 draws and 2 losses. They recently lost to Crystal Palace 1-2 at home, with a 2-2 draw in Bournemouth and a 2-0 win over Manchester United. However, they were eliminated in the 3rd round of the English Football League Cup by Oxford Town, 4-0, away from home.
                            </p>   

                            <h3>
                                What it means for Everton
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                For Everton, a win will move them out of the relegation zone and ease some of the pressure on manager Marco Silva. Depending on who scores for Everton (if anyone does), it will relieve pressure on them (especially if Sigurdsson, Dom, or Richarlison score). A draw could still lift us out of the relegation zone, but a loss would be disastrous, with 5 straight losses and 6 in 7 losses.
                            </p>                             
                            <h3>
                                What it means for West Ham
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                At the start of the season, it was predicted that West Ham would be one of the teams that could challenge for Europe. A win over Everton on Saturday will definitely increase their credentials. It will also mean that they prove themselves against another team that many predicted to be in the chasing pack for Europe (Leicster, West Ham, Wolves & Everton). Although Everton have had a poor start to the season, there is plenty of time for them to turn it around. Therefore, it's a chance to make it harder for one of their competitors to leap frog them.
                            </p>
                            <h3>
                                The stat:
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                West Ham have a goal difference of 0 in the EPL this season, with 11 goals for and 11 goals against. Everton have a woeful goal difference of -7 after 8 games, with only 6 goals scored. This is the 3rd lowest goal talley of any EPL team.
                            </p>
                            <h3>
                                The match-up
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                Diop vs Kean or Calvert-Lewin - Everton's strikers need a big match to prove their worth to the Toffee faithful and to Silva, while Diop is in form in the West Ham defence.
                            </p>
                            <h3>

                            <p>
                                Marco Silva - he's been told he has a little while left before the board acts. That little while starts now.
                            </p>
                            <h3>

                            <p>
                                Domenic Calvert-Lewin plays a good match and gets an assist
