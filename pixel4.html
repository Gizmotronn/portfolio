                                Google unveiled their 4th phone in the Pixel series last week. After the success of the Pixel 3 and the budget Pixel 3a, many of us in the tech space were waiting excitedly for Google to reveal what they've been working on for the past year. It's been compared to the Galaxy Note 10 & S10 by CNN & Android Authority, and one of the main selling points - in fact, one of the main selling points of the entire franchise - is the stock Android approach that the Pixel offers, meaning you get the latest Android updates as soon as Google releases them.
                            </p>

                            <h3>
                                Physical design
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                Let's face it, Pixels have never really had a stunning design in the same way that phones like the Oppo R9 or the Samsung Note 10 have had. This model is no exception, and it's a little disappointing that there are still massive (by today's standards) bezels on the front of the display. While the design (especially the back, with that high-tech 3 lens camera system) has certainly received an update from last year's model, it is in no way comparable to the design of a Samsung.
                            </p>
                            <figure>
                                <img src="images/pixelnote.jpg" alt="blog">
                            </figure>
                            <p>
                                That being said, the physical feel of the Pixel 4 is beautiful, with a matte back that doesn't act as a smudge machine (unlike the Samsung S10/Note 10 series). With a 5.7 inch display, the Pixel 4 is definitely big enough for most people (just imagine saying that in 2012!). 
                            </p>
                            <h3>
                                Security
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                The big talking point about Samsung this year was the in-display fingerprint scanner that debuted in the Samsung S10 in February (Vivo, a Chinese company, were the first company to release this feature in a retail smartphone). The fingerprint sensor is gone on the Pixel 4, but in its place is a super secure, super fast Face Unlock system that makes it safer than ever before to use your face as a biometric system for Google Pay  or unlocking your phone. There is a small chip in the screen of the Pixel, which is called "Soli." It helps trigger the Face Unlock process, but it also is responsible for some cool - or gimmicky - gesture controls, which I'll talk about in a bit.
                            </p>
                            <h3>
                                Gestures
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                All the way back with Android Nougat in 2016, when the App Drawer button was removed in favour of a swipe-up gesture, Google has strived to increase what we can do with gestures. Apart from the obvious "swipe up" to go home and "swipe up from bottom right" to go back (samsung) or recent apps (stock android), there hasn't really been much that gestures can do with regards to navigation. Thanks to the Soli chip, that will change with the Pixel 4 and Android 10.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                You can wave your hand in front of the screen to mute an alarm or music, and there is space for app developers to implement Soli into their apps as well. Don't fear if you own an older device, there are still gestures available for you that would rely on the front-facing camera.
                            </p>
                            <h3>
                                The Camera
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                The other big selling point of the Pixel series is the camera, and throughout the 3-year history of the Pixel it has remained unmatched by most smartphone companies. This year, it is no exception, with a 2nd lens on the back of the phone for the first time. There is no wide-angle camera like on the Note 10, however there are plenty of other cool features.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When shooting in low-light, the photos look crisp and sharp when taking pictures with the Pixel 4 camera. There's even an astrophotography mode that I hope makes its way to the Samsung series in the near future.
                            </p>
                            <h3>
                                Battery life
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                Bad news for Pixel fans - the battery has shrunk compared to the Pixel 3, with a reduction of 115 mAh (from 2915 to 2800). However, the Pixel 4XL has a battery capacity of 3700 mAh. 
                            </p>
                            <h3>

                            <p>
                                You only get the option for 64gb or 128gb with no expandable micro sd card slot. On the plus side, you get unlimited HD photo backups thanks to Google Cloud/Drive/Photos.
                            </p>
                            <h3>
                                Summary
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                Apart from a few let-downs, the Pixel 4 is a truly great device that is definitely up there with the 4 best phones on the market (not including plus variants, Samsung S10/Note 10, iPhone 11, Pixel 4, Huawei Mate 30P). Stock android is a good bonus, and if you like taking good photos on your phone you need to at least consider a Pixel 4.
