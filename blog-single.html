		<p class="excert">
			Everton Football Club have made a bid for 19-year-old Juventus striker Moise Kean. Kean, who is likely to cost the Toffees 29 million pounds + add-ons, scored 6 times in 13 appearances in the 2018-19 Serie A season. What does this mean for Everton's season? I update my previous 2019-20 Everton preview based on this recent acquisition.
		</p>
		<p>
			Moise Kean was born in Italy on 28th February 2000. He was signed by Juventus in 2016, and since then has made 16 appearances, and scored 7 goals, for the Serie A giants. However, Maurizio Sarri, the Juventus manager, has decided that Moise is not needed for the 2019-20 season, and decided to off-load him, with Everton signing Moise late last night. The price could rise to 40 million pounds with add-ons, and Juventus <i>may</i> have a buy-back clause with Everton after 2 years. Everton signed Moise to fix a serious problem with their forward line. While Richarlison (#30) and Sigurdsson (#10) both scored 14 goals for the Toffees in their 2018-19 campaign, Everton were overall a low-scoring side and have been looking for another striking option for some time. This acquisition should allow Richarlison to play as a winger, or it may open up Everton's formation to house 2 strikers, rather than the 1 that it housed for most of last season.
		</p>
		<h3>What's happened in the off-season?</h3>
		<p>
			In the off-season, Everton have signed Andre Gomes (from Barcelona, previously on loan to us), Fabian Delph (from Manchester City), and now Moise Kean. We sold Ademola Lookman to Rb Leipzig (Bundesliga) and Idrissa Gana Gueye to Paris Saint Germain (Ligue 1). Everton, led by Michael Brands & Marco Silva (manager), have made their intentions clear of signing 
			star players, including strikers. 
		</p>
		
		<h3>What happened lasst season (2018-19)?</h3>
		<p>
			Everton finished 8th last season, with a goal difference of 8 (54 scored, 46 conceded), and a 15-9-14 record. Apart from a miserable festive season (the only highlight being a 5-1 hammering of Burnley on Boxing Day down at Turf Moor), we had a good season, however our lack of options inside the box was made clear in games against Crystal Palace (0-0) and Fulham (0-2). Richarlison & Domenic Calvert-Lewin (#29) led our attack, but Domenic was not always listed with the first team, and Richarlison struggled at the middle of the season. Richarlison plays well as a left-winger, and Marco preferred a 4-5-1 style line-up, with Domenic often being the "1" striker. 
		</p>

		<h3>Richarlison - what position?</h3>
		<p>
			Richarlison is defnitely better than Calvert-Lewin. It is interesting that whenever Marco Silva played Calvert-Lewin, Richarlison was deployed as a winger, as Domenic is a striker. Fair enough. But since it is evident that Richarlison is better, Marco wants to play Richarlison as a winger. Again, fair enough. But with Richarlison, who was our joint leading goalscorer last season on the wing, who will step up in the forward line? This is why, I think, we've targeted strikers so aggressively this off-season. Richarlison plays well in both positions, but since he is the best winger at the club, it's hard to find someone else to fill that role. With Moise Kean coming in, we can have Richarlison master his craft
			in the wing, with a proven striker up front.
		</p>

		<h1> My season preview - 2019-20 </h1>

		<p>
			Leading goalkicker: Richarlison de Andrae (#30) & Glyfi Sigurdsson (#10) - 14 goals all competitions
			Fan’s player of the year: Lucas Digne (#12)



			Last season, Everton won 15 games, drew 9, and lost 14, compared to 13 wins, 10 draws, and 15 losses in the 2017-18 season. 
			We finished with 6 wins and 3 draws in our last 11 matches, losing to lowly Fulham (who were already relegated) 2-0 away and Newcastle 3-2 (after being up by 2 goals. Newcastle’s third goal was controversial, however the result stood). Against Tottenham Hotspurs in Match Day 38, we drew 2-2. If we had of held on against Newcastle, and we hadn’t of underestimated Fulham, we could have won 7 of our last 11, a result nobody would have thought possible given our dreary festive period (I think a draw was the best result we could’ve managed against the Spurs). We could have qualified for the Europa League 2019-20 season.

			Apart from those minor blips, we were flying in the last rounds of the season - 4-0 against Man United, 1-0 against Arsenal, and 2-0 against Chelsea being some big highlights. We even kept Liverpool to a 0-0 draw at the derby at Goodison, which meant that Liverpool didn’t win the league title. Richarlison & Sigurdsson continued their stellar season, both players slotting 13 goals in the premier league. For a club that finished 8th on the table, to have 2 players kick 28 goals in all competitions between them is really good. Dominic Calvert-Lewin (#29) kicked a few as well and definitely came of age last season.

			It was really hard watching Everton in the festive period. Apart from a 5-1 win against Burnley on Boxing Day (I was in New York at the time and streamed the match at a cafe) and a 2-0 win against Bournemouth, we played horribly, losing to Brighton and to Leicester City. We hovered around 11-12th during the festive season, and many supporters on Facebook talked about how we were going backwards. It definitely looked like it.

			We have finished 8th in the last 2 seasons. Overall, that looks like no improvement. But our win-loss record improved, and our goal-scoring abilities improved as well (however, as good as Richarlison has been, I wouldn’t have paid the 50 million we apparently did just for him. 35 million was definitely a better deal. I may be eating my words at the end of next season, but Richarlison was not worth 50 million last season).

			We scored 14 goals in 6 games at home at the end of the season. We turned Goodison Park into a fortress. If we can do that again next season, as well as score more heavily away, we will finish higher. To lose to Fulham and draw against Palace was disappointing - 2 teams that were at the lower end of the table.

			Overall, I think we took great steps in the 2018-19 season. But more has to be done.
		</p>

		<h2>Everton & Me</h2> 
		<p>
			I am a proud toffee supporter. I am also a proud supporter of all great Australian sportsmen and women, as Australia has very few of these. So when I joined my soccer (oops, sorry, football)-obsessed high school, I was asked what team I supported. Tim Cahill is an Australian former footballer, but at the time he had just left Everton, after being with them for 9 years (having come from Milwall in 2004 for a 1.5 million pound fee). He was much-loved at the Blues, so I became a fan.

			But it wasn’t until last year that I started following the games and looking at the stats. I still said to everyone that my team was Everton, but I didn’t know any of our players or any of our history.

			When I decided I wanted to get into football, I decided to join a bunch of Everton Facebook Groups. I started watching some replays of matches (the first one I watched was the 2-1 win against Leicester City in November). When I was in the US, I got off the plane from Hong Kong (stop-over) to New York and immediately my phone was bombarded with notifications - Everton had lost to the Spurs 6-2. A few days later, I was at an internet cafe having breakfast, and I watched the live “feed” of the commentary of the game between Everton and Burnley at Turf Moor. Suddenly, Yerry Mina scored his first goal for Everton inside 2 minutes. Then Lucas Digne scored a brilliant free kick goal, and Gylfi Sigurdsson scored from the penalty spot. We were up 3-0 before half-time.

			Digne and Richarlison both scored goals in the second half, creating a boxing-day demolition of 5-1. But the first game I watched live was against Leicester City, in Brooklyn, was a 1-0 loss. I watched us lose against Brighton & Hove Albion. The first game I saw us win live was against Bournemouth when I was in San Francisco. I set my alarm to wake me up at 5.30, but I slept through it and I only woke up at 6.30, when the game was in the 60th minute (Kurt Zouma had scored). It took me 20 more minutes to find the stream, but I saw the last 10 minutes when Domenic Calvert-Lewin scored in the last 10 seconds. It was a good day. That night I bought my first Everton kit, the 2007-08 kit, and it arrived a few days after I arrived back in Australia.
		</p>

		<h1>2019-20 Season</h1>
		<p>
				For this season to be a pass, not only do we need to finish higher than 8th (and win games that we should against teams like Fulham), we need to have a decent cup run. We crashed out in the 2 cups last season, on penalties against Southampton and against Milwall - a second division team in the FL Championship. Cups are easy to win - Watford made the FA Cup, and they finished below us. Even second division teams can occasionally have a good run - Lincoln & Milwall being examples.

				I want us to reach at least round 4 of each cup. And please, Everton, don’t lose to Milwall again.

				It is vital to turn Goodison Park into a fortress for its last few years before our new stadium is unveiled. We saw how dangerous we could be there at the end of the season. We could potentially win 10 or more home games - I forsee the majority of our away wins coming against lower-tier teams or midtable teams. The fixtures for this season will be released tomorrow - 13th June 2019.
